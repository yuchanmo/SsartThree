In October of 1960, he and Ding Guiling \u4e01\u6842\u73b2 were re-assigned to the inside-painted workshop where the Ye brothers worked and taught their students Wang Xisan \u738b\u7fd2\u4e09 and Ye Shuying \u8449\u6a39\u82f1.Apart from learning the art of inside painting from the Ye brothers, Liu Shouben and Wang Xisan both eagerly studied traditional painting, sketching, and other arts in their spare time and visited the Palace Museum whenever they could. They were both ardent students of Chinese culture in general, and both devoured books on a regular basis trying to improve their understanding of their tradition.
