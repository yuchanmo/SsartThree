Although the bell itself appears to be a later replacement, the precise casting style and texture of the decoration and patina on the vajra handle of the bell closely match that of the vajra itself.\u00a0The intricacy of the construction of both ritual vessels, especially the powerful articulation of the Buddha heads on the bell, and makara\u00a0heads on both,\u00a0pay testimony to the consummate skill of the Yongle or Xuande court craftsmen.The vajra bell (ghanta) is the companion of the vajra sceptre, representing the voidness of wisdom that is indivisible from great bliss, and the clear light transparency of ultimate voidness that complements the body of Buddhahood. Beneath the vajra handle, there is a Buddha with five-pointed jewel crown representing the five transcendent Buddhas, which are also represented by the five prongs of the vajra itself. The central round spot of the vajra handle represents the Buddha Vajrasattva, the archetypal Tantric Buddha form. The prongs emerge from the mouths of four makaras who dwell at the bottom of the universe ocean.The pairing of the vajra\u00a0with the bell symbolises compassion or the 'male' skill in means for salvation; the bell\u00a0was the symbol of supreme knowledge seen as female. Together they constituted a unity of coefficients for salvation. Held in the right and left hands respectively to make elaborate ritual movements, they are also the attributes of many deities.For other bells of this type with a Xuande reign mark and of the period, see one, in the Palace Museum, Beijing, illustrated in\u00a0Cultural Relics of Tibetan Buddhism Collected in the Qing Palace,\u00a0Hong Kong, 1992, pl. 132-1,\u00a0one sold in these rooms, 9th\u00a0October 2012, lot 311 and another included in the exhibition Sacred Symbols: The Ritual Art of Tibet, New York, 1999, cat. no. 11.\u00a0\u00a0Another 15th century gilt copper alloy vajra and bell\u00a0from the collection of the second Dalai Lama, now in the National Palace Museum, Taipei, is illustrated in\u00a0Tibetan Buddhist Art in the National Palace Museum, Taipei, 2016, p. 226, fig.

He was interrupted by the demon hordes of Mara, the 'lord of the senses'. The Buddha overcame their attempts at seduction and distraction, and in defiance moved his right hand from the meditation position to touch the ground before him. The gesture,\u00a0bhumishparsha mudra, signifies the moment of triumph over Mara in calling the earth spirit to witness his claim to enlightenment.This classic iconography of Shakyamuni Buddha is famously represented in two complete Yongle altar shrines, one in the British Museum, illustrated in Wladimir Zwalf, ed.,\u00a0Buddhism: Art and Faith, London, 1985, cat. no. 305, and the other from the Speelman Collection, sold in these rooms, 7th October 2006, lot 808. Yongle reign-marked images of Shakyamuni Buddha in this smaller scale are relatively rare.
