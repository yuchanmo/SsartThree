Tuyet and Stephen were pioneers in travelling to China as early as 1965, before it opened to the world. Early issues included a focus on the Palace Museum, Beijing, and the Temple of Heaven.The magazine quickly became recognised as the foremost international\u00a0magazine\u00a0of\u00a0Asian arts\u00a0and\u00a0antiques, with the largest\u00a0circulation\u00a0of any Asian art magazine.\u00a0Supported by leading\u00a0museums, cultural organisations,\u00a0auction houses\u00a0and\u00a0art dealers, and\u00a0collectors\u00a0and students of art, it offered essential reading for knowledge of Asian art and\u00a0culture.Both Tuyet and Stephen have now passed on, but Tuyet lived to enjoy the celebrations commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Arts of Asia in 2020, and the magazine continues to flourish in print and digital versions.Tuyet and Stephen were indefatigable art lovers, collecting across a very broad range of categories. In October 2010, Sotheby's was privileged to be entrusted by the family with a group of six rare gilt-bronze Buddhist sculptures from the early Ming period, a highly successful 'white-glove' sale which fetched a spectacular total of HKD73million.Sotheby's is delighted to be offering two sales here: the first, a collection of Buddhist metalwork sculpture; the second, a collection of jade carvings and China coast paintings. The scope of the Buddhist metalwork sale ranges from the Pala of eastern India, through the Khasa Malla kingdom of Western Nepal, to Tibet and finally China. Highlights of the sale include a powerful silver and copper-inlaid Pala figure of Manjuvajra and a magnificent large gilt sculpture of Shakyamuni Buddha.
